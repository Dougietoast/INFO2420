<h1>Project 1: Critique of a Web Site</h1>

<p>I choose to critique the site "https://www.utah.com/destinations/national-parks/" </p>
<hr>

<h2>Questions for project 1</h2>
<hr>

<ol>
    <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
    <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
    on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
    <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
    <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
    it? Why?</li>
    <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
    reasonable?</li>
    <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
    image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
    <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
    navigation well done?</li>
    <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
    the pages?</li>
    <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
    <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
</ol>

<h2>My answers to the questions</h2>
<hr>

<ol>
    <li>I think the site looks very professional. Its right to the point and simple to navigate.</li>
    <li>The site has navigation on the left that will take your to the different sections of the site. Theres a map for locating all of the park sites</li>
    <li>The website did confuse me in the beginning, but I got used to it after a while. There was just a lot of information about promotions for the parks.</li>
    <li>graphics and layout are good, but the promotions were a bit to distracting. I think they could have been put in a different section of the site.</li>
    <li>The page seems well made and it loads in 3-5 seconds, I think its reasonable.</li>
    <li>Fonts are bigger and there is plenty of space and contrast on the page. Most of the colors are white and blue, which is easy to read and fits the site.</li>
    <li>There are two locations for the navigation, one on the left and one on the top. One will take you to other parts of the site and the other will navigate the current page.</li>
    <li>For the color scheme, they use the tyipcal utah colors of white, red, and blue. They have the same colors on all pages.</li>
    <li>Window size is very responsive and can be made to any size. The layout changes to feel correct for the size, such as changing the navigation to a drop down menu on smaller screens.</li>
    <li>I like that the page naviagition bar will move was the page is explored so you know what section your in.</li>
